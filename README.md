# DS-ALGO-ML

#### Fastest Route 

●	Developed an algorithm that returned the fastest route between any two points, given a map of vertices and traffic on each path.

●	Used Dijkstra, then to improve the runtime did Pre-processing before querying similar to google-maps or yandex-maps. 

●	Pre-processing is done by ranking the vertices/nodes through contracting them based on the Importance  Criterias including node level, contracted neighbors, Shortestcover, edge difference.
